### About me

Hi, I'm **Krishna Kumar Akurathi**, a **Cloud-Native Architect** and **AI Solution Designer** with over **18 years of experience** in building **scalable, secure, and stable enterprise-grade applications**.

Throughout my career, I’ve architected and led the development of cloud-native platforms leveraging **microservices, container orchestration, event-driven patterns**, and **zero-trust security models**. My core strength lies in turning business needs into **resilient, high-performance architectures** using platforms like **AWS, Kubernetes, and modern API gateways**.

In recent years, I’ve expanded my focus into **AI-driven architectures**, designing solutions that combine traditional systems with **LLMs, intelligent agents**, and **multi-modal pipelines**. I’m passionate about building AI systems that are not just reactive, but **autonomous, context-aware**, and capable of **agentic decision-making**.

#### What I Specialize In:
- **Cloud-Native Architecture**: AWS (Fargate, Lambda, Step Functions), Kubernetes, CI/CD, observability, and cost-efficient scaling
- **Security-First Design**: OAuth 2.0, OIDC, Keycloak, AWS IAM, encrypted data pipelines, multi-tenant access control
- **AI & GenAI Solutions**:
  - Architecting **AI Agents** and **multi-agent systems** for real-world tasks
  - Building secure **RAG workflows**, **document automation**, and **AI assistants**
  - Experimenting with tools like **LangGraph, CrewAI**, and foundation models (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude)
- **Product Engineering**: From ideation and PoC to production-grade delivery, with a strong focus on maintainability and user experience

#### Current Interests:
- Designing **AI-powered agents** for internal knowledge orchestration and operational automation
- Creating a **GPT-powered assistant** to simplify community management using secure, privacy-first designs
- Writing technical articles and sharing best practices around **AI, cloud, and modern software patterns**
